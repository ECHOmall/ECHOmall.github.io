 <pre>                                                          <img title="Spa" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c3/47/a0/c347a009c22577700beaa0324bdae9c1.jpg" width="40%" height="500"></pre>
   <h2>Improved Blood Flow and Circulation: Making a spa date for yourself has quite a number of benefits which you shouldn’t miss out on. One is such is that a massage stimulates blood flow increasing circulation in the same way it also regulates one’s blood pressure. This is helpful to your health and helps your body with fighting off illnesses and diseases. Spas offer services ranging from heat therapy; hydrotherapy and massage vastly speed upcirculation and reduce blood pressure.</h2><br>
   <pre>                                                          <img title="Spa" src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/df/1c/0c/df1c0c15b1c9298a3e06b5b0fa619c30.jpg" width="40%" height="500"></pre><br>
  <h2> Increased Productivity: There is something about taking the day off to relax that leave you feeling brand new. Looking good and in turn feeling good not only benefits your mood but also increases your productivity level. For instance, a fresh set of beautifully painted nails can be a reminder that your life is in order-a feeling you can also transfer to carrying out your day-to-day activities. Taking out a day to pamper yourself might just be the incentive you need to do more when performing your functions.></h2><br>
    <pre>                                                          <img title="Spa" src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/29/a1/2c/29a12c7c0ac995573f7dc29505c80bfb.jpg" width="40%" height="500"></pre>
   <h2>Stress Relief: You probably spend most of your time at work or doing other things which causes you to become stressed out. This is why you need a spa day. Stress is not new, in fact, all humans have to deal with it at one time or another.Stress could trigger headaches, tension, anxiety, irritability, as well as other negative effects not only on your body but also on your mind. Taking a day off to pamper yourself at the spa allows you to relax and manage your stress effectively. The meditation and massage services offered by spas provide great stress relief. This is why it is advised that you take the day off to relax.</h2>

   <br><h2>Detoxification: One added advantage to taking a spa day is that you have a whole day to detoxify. Spa treatments often include a combination of deep cleansing, massages and moisturisation. Body treatments, facials and scrubs not only remove impurities, but they also help soften the skin. The steam in a sauna/steam rooms helps you sweat out toxins, a massage helps your lymphatic system flush out toxins from your body. Detoxification purifies your body, building your immune system, leading to a healthy life.</h2><br>

   <h2>Relieves Body Pain And Ache: It is no news that more than often doctors recommend massages as a form of pain relief. A good massage takes not only away aches and pain, but it also helps with joint pain conditions like arthritis. The only thing you have to do is to inform your therapist of pre-existing conditions before the massage. This way they know the exact areas to focus on. It is recommended that you take a spa day at least once a month for your muscles’ sake.</h2>
   <pre>                                                          <img title="Spa" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/52/ec/30/52ec30a79ef3d57f5caa4ee430557f53.jpg" width="40%" height="500"></pre>
   <h2>Great Looking Skin: One effective remedy for great, glowing skin is facials. And luckily, these facials are more often than not included in spa treatments. Getting a facial renews your skin giving you a healthy and youthful glow. These facial treatments range from cleansing, exfoliation, treatment products. The benefits of facials do not end at just relaxation, but facials also help maintain your skin removing signs of ageing by smoothing wrinkles and tearing acne and breakouts.Facials remove dead skin cells, allowing shiny new ones to be revealed.</h2>
    <pre>                                                          <img title="Spa" src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/21/99/b1/2199b1d61519f8f2429bc8c401bbae15.jpg" width="40%" height="500"></pre>
